# ECG-Arrhythmia-Classification-Using-CNN-BiLSTM
This project implements a CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model for classifying ECG arrhythmias. CNN extracts spatial features from ECG signals, while BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies, improving diagnostic accuracy. The model enhances real-time arrhythmia detection, supporting clinical decision-making and better patient outcomes.
